# Informed Consent Ontology (ICO)

Informed Consent Ontology (ICO) represents the documentations and processes involved in informed consent. ICO aims to support informed consent data integration and reasoning in the clinical research space. 

As part of the consenting process in human subjects research, potential participants receive information about the purpose of the study, potential risks and benefits of participation, their rights, and the procedures to be undergone as part of the study. If the individual decides to participate, an informed consent document is signed and preserved as a record of voluntary participation in the research study. Following the OBO Foundry principles and aligned with the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO), the ICO logically represents the terms and their relations related to the informed consent process and content. ICO covers various topics related to informed consent, for example, informed consent forms, the components inside informed consent forms, and various informed consent processes.
