## Editor's note (FJM).
When using or expanding this ontology, it is important to note that care has been taken to use definitions of classes and relations with meaning to the legal community. This differs from many OBO Foundry ontologies whose underlying definitions are biological. For example, for the definition of "child" we could have imported the "child" class from the [Human Phenotype Ontology \(HPO\)](http://human-phenotype-ontology.github.io/). However, "child" in HPO  refers to a specific biological age (a human developmental stage that covers the period from birth until 12 years old) whereas the definition of a child according to the Common Rule is "Children are persons who have not attained the legal age for consent to treatments or procedures involved in the research, under the applicable law of the jurisdiction in which the research will be conducted."
