List of to-dos for ICO and RUBRIC

Terms to add:
1. We have 'specimen' from OBI_0100051, but if we could get 'DNA specimen' or 'biological specimen' that'd be great
2. We have 'repository of documents' (ICO_0000118) but if we could get 'biorepository' either from an OntoBee search or we create it that'd be great
3. I see a bunch of terms under "Needs review," but I think we will want to spell out some more directives (these are all used on my slides, but I think we should combine them), as I believe they belong in either ICO or RUBRIC's ontology (prolly ICO?):
3a. Genetic testing directive
3b. Directive regarding specimen
3c. Directive regarding biological specimen
3d. Directive regarding DNA specimen
3e. Directive regarding research on specimen
4. We don't have 'medical procedure', and I think we should be able to get it in (OntoBee?) just as we have OBI terms 'investigation' and 'human research investigation'
5. Terms from OMRSE: https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/omrse - Neil might say that these can be in an application ontology and need not be brought into our ontology.
5a. 'age measurement datum' OMRSE_00000088
5b. 'ethnic identity datum' OMRSE_00000100
5c. 'gender identity datum' OMRSE_00000133
5d. 'female gender identity datum' OMRSE_00000138 (optional)
5e. 'male gender identity datum' OMRSE_00000141 (optional)
5f. 'racial identity datum' OMRSE_00000098
6. I see you have 'health information entity' (ICO_0000101) and 'medical record' (OMIABIS_0001026), but I don't see 'electronic health record'
7. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0500028
8. http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0001755

Up Next:
- SEE OBI DICEs
- Accreditation?
- 'act of exemption'
- 'vunerable individual role' and 'vunerabilty' need annotation properties explaining usage
- ICO or RUBRIC needs to have 'material transfer agreements' and perhaps processes of material transfer
- RUBRIC: 'Answer directive' label to 'user-input'
- RUBRIC: Every conditional will have a trigger condition description ('if') and a consequent directive ('then').
- Medical procedure should be 'research procedure' and 'clinical procedure'
- Planned and Actual study duration measurements are different
- Different states for informed consent forms
  - pre-approval vs approved vs filled out (where does each class fall?)
- Informing does not have to be human-human. I can learn from a book. New class?
- Import RO temporal relations
- add RO to imports
- RUBRIC: specimen use/data use
- Are these social acts?
  - 'canceling a permission'
  - 'declining to provide consent'
- 'consenter' and 'agent' not the same superclass (per JV's email)?
- short form consent?
- add principal investigator role from OBI (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/OBI_0000103)
  - due we need different levels between PI and institution?
- directive regarding research of biospecimens
- genetic testing directive
- genetic testing procedure?
- excess material?
- datetime of consent?

Final:
- RUBRIC: For all CCO terms, add the license info in an annotation property
- Spell check all annotations
- Grammar check all annotations
- All definitions have 'genus - differentia' form
- Protege reasoner to check axiomatic consistency
- Resolve synonyms:
  - Known issues: permissions/permitee, subject/person/agent/patient
- FOL is consistent
- review all obsolete classes
- new PURLS resolve in OBO
- 'research study' should be replaced by OBI: investigation
- create ontology publishing process
